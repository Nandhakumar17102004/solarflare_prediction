Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras to classify solar magnetogram images into flare intensity classes (e.g., A, B, C, M).
Performed image preprocessing and label conversion for binary classification (flare vs. no-flare) using class mapping and statistical balancing.
Trained and evaluated the model using accuracy and confusion matrix; applied ImageDataGenerator for augmentation and ReduceLROnPlateau for adaptive learning.
Exported the trained model and representative test images for UI integration in a potential deployment phase.
